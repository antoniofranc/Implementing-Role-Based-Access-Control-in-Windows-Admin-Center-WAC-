# Implementing Role-Based Access Control in Windows Admin Center (WAC)

## Lab Scenario
As a network defender, you should be aware of the various tools and tricks available to manage the servers and clients. WAC enables network defenders to perform administrative tasks on any client (except mobile devices). It uses role-based access control (RBAC) to control the activity of the users connected to the server. WAC allows management of system activity such as starting various services, adding and removing resources, and controlling applications.

## Lab Objectives
This lab will demonstrate how to install WAC and configure RBAC in WAC to restrict user activities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview of WAC
The Windows Admin Center (WAC) is a web-based administration tool used to manage server and client operating systems, hyper-converged clusters, and failover clusters. Some of the features of WAC are listed below:
- Device management
- Windows event management
- File management
- Firewall management
- Local users and groups management
- Network management
- PowerShell tool
- Process tool
- Registry tool
- Remote desktop
- Role and features
- Services, storage, updates, etc.

In WAC, RBAC provides limited access to users on the target computers. RBAC in WAC works by configuring every managed server with a PowerShell Just-Enough Administration endpoint. The roles are defined by the endpoint. After connecting to the restricted endpoint, a temporary local administrator account is created for managing the machine. If the user is not managing the machine utilizing WAC, then the temporary account will be automatically deleted. When the user connects to the system with the configured RBAC, the WAC will initially check whether or not the user is a local administrator. If the user is a local administrator, then the user can access WAC without restrictions; otherwise, WAC will check whether the user is assigned to any predefined roles. The user will get limited access to the system if the user belongs to a WAC role but is not a full administrator. If the user is not an administrator or a member of a role, then the user will not get access to the machine.

WAC supports the following built-in roles.

`Administrators`: Allows users to use most WAC features without granting them access to Remote Desktop or PowerShell.

`Readers`: Allows users to view information and settings on the server, but not make changes.

`Hyper-V Administrators`: Allows users to make changes to the Hyper-V VMs and switches but limits other features to read-only access.

21- We have added `Webserver` to the `Windows Admin Center`. A network defender can now manage the Webserver through WAC.

22- By utilizing the RBAC option in WAC, a network defender can provide only limited access to the user of `Web server` VM. Here, we will see assigning limited access to the already created user (john) in web Server VM. To configure RBAC for user `john`, click `Settings` at the bottom of the `Tools` pane on the left.

23- The `Setting` pane appears. Click `Role-based Access Control`.

27- Reconnecting to `Webserver` is done. Navigate to `Tools -> Settings`. Click the `Role-based Access Control` option. You can see that the `Role-based access control` status is `Applied`. The `Remove` button appears at the bottom of the page.

If the status of `Role-based access control` does not change to applied, then perform `Steps#23-27` again.

28- RBAC is now added to `Webserver`.

Next, Assign a user to the role. Click `Local users & groups` in the `Tools` pane on the left.

-----
39- Since we have logged in as `John` to `Windows Admin Center`, `Webserver` is connected with limited access (It is shown at the upper left corner as `Webserver (Limited Access)`.

40- As a user of `Webserver`, you can try to add new storage to it. But, as we have added the user john in RBAC and allowed for limited access permission only, the system will not allow user `John` to add new storage.

41- Click `Storage` in the Tools pane. Wait for a few seconds; the `Storage` pane appears on the right side of the window.

<img width="400" height="684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6905c404-7050-44c6-9156-6a0ece307415" />
